# Below The Arithmetical Mean
# When given a list, the program should return a list of all the elements below the original listâ€™s arithmetical mean. The arithmetical mean is the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.
# Example: [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 2, 3] (The arithmetical mean is 4.25), Return [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]
def below_the_arithmetical_mean(ary):
  mean = sum(ary) / len(ary)
  ans = []
  for i in ary:
    if i < mean:
      ans.append(i)

  return ans

# Two Lowest Elements
# When given a list of elements, find the two lowest elements.
# They can be equal to each other or different.
# Example: [198, 3, 4, 9, 10, 9, 2], Return: 2, 3
